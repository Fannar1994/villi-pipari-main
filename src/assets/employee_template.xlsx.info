This is a placeholder for the Excel template file for employee timesheets.
The actual binary Excel file would need to be uploaded separately as it cannot be created as text.

The template should follow this structure:
- Title row with "Tímaskýrsla" (Timesheet)
- Month-Year row (e.g., "Mar-25")
- Employee names in columns 
- Days of month in rows (01/03/2025, 02/03/2025, etc.)
- Red text for Icelandic holidays
- Summary row at the bottom with total hours
